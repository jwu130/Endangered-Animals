		<p>The snow leopard (Panthera uncia syn. Uncia uncia) is a large cat native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia. It is listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species because, as of 2003, the size of the global population was estimated at 4,080â€“6,590 adults, of which fewer than 2,500 individuals may reproduce in the wild.
		Drawing from the latest available data, the Global Snow Leopard and Eco-System Protection Program (GSLEP)[3] uses an estimate of between 3,920 and 6,390 individuals in the wild.
		Snow leopards inhabit alpine and subalpine zones at elevations from 3,000 to 4,500 m (9,800 to 14,800 ft). In the northern range countries, they also occur at lower elevations.
		Taxonomically, the snow leopard was classified as Uncia uncia since the early 1930s.[2] Based on genotyping studies, the cat has been considered a member of the genus Panthera since 2008.[1][5] Two subspecies have been attributed, but genetic differences between the two have not been settled.</p>

		<p>The snow leopard was first described by Schreber in 1775 on the basis of an illustration. Schreber named the cat Felis uncia and assumed that it ranges in Barbary, Persia, East India, and China.In 1854, Gray proposed the genus Uncia, to which he subordinated the snow leopard under the name Uncia irbis.[10] Pocock corroborated this classification, but attributed the scientific name Uncia uncia. He also described morphological differences between snow leopards and the then-accepted members of Panthera.Based on genotyping studies, the snow leopard has been considered a member of the genus Panthera since 2008.[5] Despite the common name given to the snow leopards, the tiger is considered its sister species, with the leopard being a more distant relative.</P>
