                    LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.

                <p>
                    According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CIA Director Porter Goss lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as:
                <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
                    <li>the Cold War</li>
                    <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
                    <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
